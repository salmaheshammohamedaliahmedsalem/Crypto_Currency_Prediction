Sleep State Detection
This project aims to detect sleep states using a combination of data collection, preprocessing, and machine learning algorithms. The objective is to classify different sleep states such as wakefulness, light sleep, deep sleep, and REM (Rapid Eye Movement) sleep based on input data from various sensors.
